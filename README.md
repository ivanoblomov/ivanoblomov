# Rails & iOS Mercenary

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently:
    - working with WeHealth to help underserved communities [get access to Covid-19 vaccinations](https://wehealthsite.wordpress.com/2021/03/16/the-covid-vaccine-in-under-served-communities/). If you're in LA County, DM your zip code to [@vaccinesignup](https://twitter.com/vaccinesignup) and we'll let you know about vaccine appointments as they become available.
    - working on new versions of my iOS apps
- ðŸŒ± and learning:
    - the latest iOS 14 APIs.
- ðŸ‘¯ Meanwhile, I'm also looking to help early-stage startups with their iOS or Rails needs.
